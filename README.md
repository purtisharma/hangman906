## Leanrnings
In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), I learned that the use of classes and methods demonstrates key principles of OOP, such as encapsulation, initialization, and method calls. I also learned that user interaction and handling user input, as well as providing feedback, are crucial aspects of programming.
